      <h3>Needlestick Exposure</h3>
      <p>
        Exposure to blood and body fluids, due to needlesticks and splashes, represents real hazards to healthcare workers. Blood and body fluids can be infected with hepatitis or HIV. If you are exposed during the course of your work duties, you should follow a few steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are splashed in the eye, rinse your eye out with water.</li>
        <li>If you are stuck with a needle, clean the site with soap and water. Alcohol or iodine is also acceptable. The important step is to clean it immediately after exposure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Next, report the exposure to both Baylor OHP and the institution in which it occurred. OHP provides counseling and follow up. The institution will perform testing on the source patient. Procedures vary by hospital, so follow their instructions. Below are contact details for each institution:

      <h3>Incident Reporting</h3>
      <h4>Informal Pathways for Resolution</h4>
      <p>
        We encourage that student complaints be resolved, if possible, by the student and the individual (student, faculty, trainee, and/or staff) most closely related to the complaint. If no resolution is established, the student may ask their supervisor, program director, or dean for assistance.
      </p>
      <h4>Formal Pathways for Resolution</h4>
      <p>
        If the complaint cannot be informally resolved, the student must be directed to the Integrity Hotline and recommended to file a written appeal or grievance.
        Students are strongly encouraged to review the Student Appeals and Grievances Policy, the Student Grievances Process, and the Student Appeals and Grievances Training prior to submission of a formal appeal or grievance.
